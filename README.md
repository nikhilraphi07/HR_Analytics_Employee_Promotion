This model is build as part of the HR Analytics Hackathon ny Analytics Vidya
Machine Learning Model in python which will be predicting the emploees who have the most likelihood of being promoted based on various other factors within the organization.	


### Run Locally
============================================================================
- Run the Final_WNS_Model.ipynb file which is the python notebook


### Project Structure
* Final_WNS_Model.ipynb -The python notebook containing the final ML model
* Model2.ipynb - Secondary python notebook with model implemented for cross validation
* train_LZdllcl - Trainign dataset consisting of approx 55K records
* test_2umaH9m  - Testing dataset on which the prediction needs to be done.
* sample_submission_M0L0uXE - Submission file for checkig the solution and accuracy of the model
